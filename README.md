# Project: MVVM+C Architecture with Tab Bar and Combined Technologies

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of modern MVVM+C architecture with a tab bar built in UIKit and views built in SwiftUI. It also features a robust network layer built on Combine for handling requests and state management.

## Key Technologies and Architecture

- **MVVM+C Architecture:**
  - **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** Separates view logic from business logic, making the code easier to test and maintain.
  - **Coordinator (C):** Manages navigation in the app, making it more organized and modular.

- **UI Technologies:**
  - **UIKit:** Used for implementing the tab bar, providing powerful and familiar functionality for managing tabs.
  - **SwiftUI:** Used for creating views, allowing the use of modern declarative approaches for building user interfaces.

- **Combine:**
  - **Text Field Validation:** Uses Combine for real-time text field validation.
  - **Network Layer:** A full-featured network layer built on Combine for handling requests, managing data streams, and updating the UI based on network state.

## Project Features

- **Tab Bar in UIKit:** Provides a powerful and customizable interface for managing tabs.
- **Views in SwiftUI:** Utilizes modern declarative approaches for building user interfaces.
- **Combined Technologies:** Leverages the best of both UIKit and SwiftUI.
- **Validation and Network Layer with Combine:** Provides powerful tools for working with asynchronous data and reactive streams.
